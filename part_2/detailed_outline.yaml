    - 30 min
  - Objectives:
    - Introduce the concentp of reproducible workflows
    - Present SnakeMake Wrappers as a easy alternative to run bioinfomartic tools  
  - Sections:
    - Introduction to computational workflows
    - Do we need a workflow manager?
    - What is computational portability?
    - Why we should spend time documenting our analysis and workflows
    - What are the pros- and cons- of Snakemake as workflow manager

Differential Splicing from RNA-Seq:
  - Duration:
    - 30 min
  - Objectives:
    - High-level introduction to the different software packages
  - Sections: 
    intron -exon definition break 
    - Premature RNA splicing from the perspective of a bioinformatician
    - Exon-exon junctions or splicing-junctions (SJ) 
    - Examples of mis-splicing and human disease 
    - The splicing code and how different tissues produce different transcript isoforms
    - Types of AS
    - Consequences of AS (1) different UTR; (2) NMD isoforms (10.1038/s41467-017-00370-5); (3) cell differentiation (10.1182/blood-2016-01-692764); (4) protein-protein interactions (10.1016/j.molcel.2012.05.039); (4) different ORF
    - Difference between ATSS/ATTS and AS


Introduction to Differential Transcript Usage (DTU):
  - Duration:
    - 60 min
  - Objectives:
    - Given an RNA-Seq dataset 
  - Sections:
    - DTU is complementar to DGE
    - Transcripts from same gene may have different functions (functionally different gene products)
    - More importantly, tissue-specific isoforms may help us to understand human disease
