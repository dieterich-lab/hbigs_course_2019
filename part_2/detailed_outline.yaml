Differential Splicing from RNA-Seq:
  - Sections:
    - Premature RNA splicing from the perspective of a bioinformatician
    - RNA splicing refresher
    - Mis-splicing and human disease 
    - Properties of the splice sites
    - Define, annotation, gtf gff, and the gene structure model
    - Elements of annotation, genes, transcripts, exons, CDS and UTRs  
    - DGE the total expression produced by all isoforms of a gene 
    - DTU isoform specific 
    - Annotation is a model, but don't work for every  disease or tissue
    - Alternative splicing types
    - Alternative and mis-splicing consequences (NMD, truncated domain or change on traffic)
    - The splicing code
    - 75% of introns are missing from annotations 
    - Short- vs long-read RNA-Seq (Illumina vs Nanopore)
  - Duration:
    - 45 min
  - Questions:
    - How to identify splice junctions from RNA-Seq experiments
    - Why mis-splicing applies to human disease
    - On the splice graph, what are the splicing-junctions (SJ)
    - What are the important parameters while designing an experiment to detect alternative splicing
  - Objective:
    - Introduce splicing from the bioinformatician perspective
    - Define jargon used on splicing analysis 


Introduction to Differential Transcript Usage (DTU):
  - Sections:
    - Salmon, a fast way to compute transcript abundance
    - DTU is complementary to DGE
    - DRIM-Seq computes the change of transcript's proportions
    - Alternatives to DRIM-Seq (mention DEXSeq, IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR)
    - DTU is intuitive, but is limited by the annotation 
  - Duration:
    - 60 min
  - Objective:

Differential splicing analysis from event level perspective:
  - Sections:
    - Unbiased approach to splicing events (annotation-independent)
    - Majiq algorithm
    - Leafcutter algorithm
    - These approaches do not rely on transcript models or pre-defined splicing events  
    - Enable the association of splicing variants and patient mutations 
    - Requires more work to understand AS consequences
  - Duration:
    - 30 min
  - Questions:
    - What are the advantages and barriers to AS identification using leafcutter
  - Objective:
    - Learn the background of the new methods for DS analysis
    - Understand the different use cases between transcript- and event- level analysis 


Hand-on Using Leafcutter from Baltica:
  - Sections:
    - Baltica facilitates integration and comparison of different DS methods
    - Vizualization, IGV (no hands-on)
    - For annotated transcripts, use Ensembl, UniProt and UCSC Genome Browser (tomorrow) 
    - Computational methods to compute protein disorder
    - Transcript sub-cellular location prediction
    - ORF and NMD
  - Duration:
    - 60 min
  - Questions:
    - Why do we need workflow managers
    - What is the easiest way to identify the potential consequence of a new intron
  - Objective:
