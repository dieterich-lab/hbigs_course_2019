# Introduction to long and short RNA-seq analysis 

## Part 2: Approaches for differential splicing analysis from RNA-Seq data

In this section we will learn how to extract more information from RNA-Seq experiments. Three approaches are introduced:  *de novo* transcriptomics; differential transcript usage (DTU); and differential junction usage. We will present the usecases for each approache and have a hands-on experience with DJU. 

### Methods for splicing analysis:

1. Workflow managers for reproducible computational research with [**SnakeMake**](https://github.com/snakemake/snakemake)
1. Beyond the reference annotation
	1. *de novo* transcriptomics with [**StringTie**](https://github.com/gpertea/stringtie)
1. Transcript switching analysis:
	1. Transcript abundance estimation with [**Salmon**](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon)
	1. DTU with [**DRIMSeq**](https://github.com/gosianow/DRIMSeq)
