# HBIGS course 2019: Introduction to long and short RNA-seq analysis

### Dates and venue

24.10 from 9.00-17.00. Seminar room AZIII 03.434 (Im Neuenheimer Feld 669).

25.10 from 9.00-17.00. Seminar room AZIII 02.332 (Im Neuenheimer Feld 669). 

### Description

This repository contains material for the HBIGS course 2019. The workshop's main objective is to learn how to use 
selected bioinformatics workflows and tools to analyse RNA- and Ribo-seq data. To attain this objective, participants will
be led through a series of practical exercises. 

We will be using a subset of the data from [D.A. Rothenberg et al. A Proteomics Approach to Profiling the Temporal Translational Response to Stress and Growth. iScience. 2018; 9:367-381.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004218301949?via%3Dihub)

### Requirements
Before the course, you need to:
1. make sure you have a functional laptop with eduroam connection, and bring it with you;
2. have a minimal understanding of the basic bash/linux commands, see *e.g.* [The linux command line for beginner](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/command-line-for-beginners);
3. install X2Go Client on your laptop, see [how to get X2Go](https://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php/download:start).

You do not need to install any other packages. A background in programming is not necessary.
